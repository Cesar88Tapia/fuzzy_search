# fuzzy_search
Clip Challange


Implement a fuzzy search algorithm for transactions with the following requirements:
Have a web page with one input field where a user can enter text, and a displayed list of transactions
Display the full list of transactions when the input field is empty
Update the displayed list of transactions as the user types in the input field (only show transactions that match the fuzzy search criteria)
Show the transactions in order by date
Fuzzy search must account for all transaction object properties (amount, date, card_last_four).

Tech Stack:
React
Express
Body Parser
Babel
Webpack

Instructions:
If you don't have node.js installed in your PC, install it so that the Fuzzy Search can work when running npm install, then npm run start, npm run start-dev, and visit localhost:3000.
